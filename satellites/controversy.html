          <p class="mx-auto text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-800">According to Union of Concerned
            Scientists (UCS), which keeps a record of the operational satellites, there are 6,542 satellites, out of
            which 3,372 satellites are active and 3,170 satellites are inactive, as recorded by 1st January, 2021.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="mx-auto text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-800">According to NASA, there are millions
            of pieces of junk flying in LEO, which comprises of Space craft, tiny flecks of paint from Space craft,
            parts of rockets and satellites that are either dead or lost, including objects that are results of
            explosions in the Space.</p>

          <p class="mx-auto text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-800">Most of this “Space junk” is flying at
            very high speed and there are high chances of unwarranted accidents to happen, which will produce a
            dangerous amount of Space debris as well as disturb the channels of the neighboring active satellites,
            transmitting critical information to astronauts and International Space Centers, it holds potential to
            create a chain reaction leading to mass disaster. This also poses a threat to safety of people and property
            on Earth.

          <p class="mx-auto text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-800">Despite the promise of high-speed
            broadband internet, SpaceX has taken criticism within the astronomical community for its Starlink
            satellites, due to their brightness and potential to disrupt observations of the night sky..

          <p class="mx-auto text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-800">In response, SpaceX has begun
            outfitting their satellites with a blackened sunshade – called VisorSat – that the company hopes will reduce
            the satellite’s apparent brightness by reducing the amount of sunlight that’s reflected.
