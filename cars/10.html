            world's greatest 2+2 sports car - and that's certainly the goal for the Aston Martin DB9 - there really is
            no substitute for a V12," says Aston Martin's Chief Powertrain Engineer Brian Fitzsimons. "Aston Martin's
            V12 is acknowledged as one of the best in the world, so was a very good starting point."</p>

          <h2 class="mx-auto mt-4 mb-4 text-xl font-semibold text-black">Fisker describes his aesthetic as innovative
            and timeless. His designs are long and muscular, drawing inspiration from the human body as well as classic
            cars from the past.</h2>
          <p class="mx-auto text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-800">He is inspired by Italian car designs, as well as American designs. In particular, the
            luxury and muscle cars of the 1950s, '60s and '70s inspire Fisker's designs. He is highly concerned with
            proportion, designing his cars with flowing lines, short overhangs, and an assertive stance.</p>
