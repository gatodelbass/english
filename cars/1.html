            Lunn, who already developed a preliminary design in the GT Program Book, along with Carroll Shelby and a few
            other Ford officials. Their first job was to identify a team that could build the cars. As project
            engineers, they chose Eric Broadley, whose Lola GT was considered groundbreaking, and John Wyer, who had won
            Le Mans with Carroll Shelby driving for Aston Martin as the race manager. </h2>

            engineering and design marvels demonstrating Ford's dedication and perseverance. In a few short years, under
            the direction of Henry Ford II, the company built a program from scratch that reached the pinnacle of
            international motorsports competition - and stayed there for four racing seasons.

            Perhaps the world's most significant - and glamorous - motorsport contest, Le Mans in the early 1960s was
            showing signs of becoming a Ferrari showcase, because the Italians had become the leaders in a number of
            endurance classes and events. But the Ford GT race car changed Le Mans forever, and today it signifies a new
            era for Ford Motor Company.
