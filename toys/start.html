                        plastic construction toys, from a company based in Billund, Denmark. The company's flagship
                        product, Lego, consists of variously coloured interlocking plastic bricks accompanying an array
                        of gears, figurines called minifigures, and various other parts

                    <p class="mx-auto text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-800 my-2">Mattel had a hit with
                        their small model cars with plastic wheels that allowed kids to make them zoom around. Countless
                        designs and colors mean there is a car that can appeal to just about anyone.

                        With the introduction of toy racing tracks, they became an even bigger smash.

                        with water guns and foam sports balls, they had one product, the Nerf Ball, which was marketed
                        as "the world's first indoor ball." The foam material promised to be less destructive than any
                        other ball. Now the brand has expanded to toy weapons and more.

                    <p class="mx-auto text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-gray-800">Uno is still an incredibly
                        popular card game. The whole point is to be the first to get rid of all your cards, but don't
                        forget to yell out "UNO" when you are down to your final card or else you have to pick up seven
                        more cards.

                        There are a lot more options now including video games and themed packs, but nothing beats the
                        simple original.

                        immensely more popular. The wheel had a better grasp on pavement and provided a safer experience
                        for the skaters. It's a cultural icon.

                        to do nothing. Though the fad ended pretty quickly, Dahl's simple idea made him a millionaire.

                        According to the National Toy Hall of Fame, it's the most popular puzzle in history.

                        Each move makes the tower taller and unstable. You don't want to be the one to knock it down.

                        Jenga was trademarked in 1983, but the game didn't gain popularity until a few years later.

                        of the game required constant attention, because the pet could die without frequent interaction.

                        The game has since become more popular through video game versions.
