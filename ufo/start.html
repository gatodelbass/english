              The Boeing F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornet are twin-engine,
              carrier-capable, multirole fighter aircraft variants based on the
              McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. The F/A-18E single-seat and
              F/A-18F tandem-seat variants are larger and more advanced
              derivatives of the F/A-18C and D Hornet. The Super Hornet
              underwent U.S. Navy operational tests and evaluations in 1999, and
              was approved in February 2000.
